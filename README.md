# ML_Algorithms
Hello 🙂 , I'm thrilled to announce that I will be uploading all Machine Learning 🤖 algorithm one by one. I'm sharing a "Linear regression" model's practical application and mathematical explanation today.
📚 Learning the Basics: In this post you will able to find the fundamental of Linear Regression and how we plot "Best Fit Line" using model.
🔍 Hands-On Practice: Here, I used simple "Housing Price Prediction" dataset is taken. # Aim is know how exactly the ML algorithm work in real world.
🐍 Jupyter Notebook Magic: I brought it all together using Jupyter Notebook in Python. It's an incredibly versatile tool for data analysis and machine learning.
